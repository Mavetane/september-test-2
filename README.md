## Server Side

### What I did..

I created a model for capturing user's personal details with it's various fields. Then created a route which will register the user details to my database. For database purposes I used MongoDB local I created a table called "Customers" and a collection called "customers".
For company names I hardcoded the details in an array of objects and created a route to get them on the front end

### Running the server

> npm install
> nodemon server.js (for starting the server)
